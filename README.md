# Introduction
Generally speaking, the purpose of Business Location Selection is to identify optimal place for
all kinds of business business activities. Especially, location is also one of the most important
factors for small business because the sustainability of small businesses significantly relies on
visibility to attract target clients. Also the location influences the costs small businesses have to
spent on the advertising, promotion and distributions. Nowadays, many economic offices
develop such a tool for their clients with basic information (rent, address) to choose business
location. However, the appropriate weighting of the various facilities in the region should also be
considered for business location selection. In this project, our group develop a Business Location
Evaluation System (BLES) for small business in Windsor. The data for evaluating a business
location is provided by open-data and the algorithm we use in this system are based on the
research within business location decision area.
